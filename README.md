# App Overview

This fitness tracker app is aimed at tracking daily calorie intake and workouts. We developed this app to address the challenge of monitoring daily calorie consumption and exercise routines, which we found challenging on a day-to-day basis. The app is tailored for regular use and offers significant benefits in tracking and recording daily calorie intake. Built using React Native, it leverages various libraries including React Navigation for seamless navigation and Ionicons for iconography. The app comprises two main screens: the HomeScreen for initiating the fitness journey and the AddDayScreen for inputting daily calorie intake and deducting calories through workout options. Users can view a list of previous entries displaying the remaining calories for each day, aiding in progress tracking. AsyncStorage ensures data persistence, enhancing user experience. Overall, it provides users with an intuitive solution for monitoring their fitness progress and achieving their health goals effectively.
